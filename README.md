# helloPython
This repository is dedicated to documenting my progress and development during my Python learning journey, using the [30-Days-Of-Python](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python) repository by Asabeneh as a guide.

### hello.py
This first file allowed me to learn about the different data types that Python has. I also realized that most programming languages handle the same data types. This is done to enable precise operations.
