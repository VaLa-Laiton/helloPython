# helloPython

This repository is dedicated to documenting my progress and development during my Python learning journey, using the [30-Days-Of-Python](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python) repository by Asabeneh as a guide.

### hello.py

This first file allowed me to learn about the different data types that Python has. I also realized that most programming languages handle the same data types. This is done to enable precise operations.

### variables.py

In this file, I address the reserved keywords in Python, as well as the magic methods, which are identified by double underscores at the beginning and end of the reserved keyword. I also present the ways to declare variables: the conventional way and the second way, which consists of declaring variables in a single line.
